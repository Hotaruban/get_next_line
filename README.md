### The "get_next_line" project challenges participants to implement a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, providing practical insights into input handling and memory allocation in C. In this iteration, participants are encouraged to leverage linked lists to manage multiple file descriptors simultaneously, enhancing their understanding of linked list usage.

### Key Points:

**Line Reading**: Participants are tasked with creating a function capable of reading a line (up to a newline character) from a specified file descriptor.

**Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Efficient memory usage is crucial. Participants must dynamically allocate memory to store each read line and ensure proper deallocation to prevent memory leaks.

**Buffer Management**: The project involves managing input buffers effectively, especially when dealing with scenarios where a line spans multiple buffer reads.

**Linked List Implementation**: To extend the functionality to handle multiple file descriptors, participants are encouraged to use linked lists. Each file descriptor is associated with its own linked list, allowing for independent line reading.

**File Descriptor Handling**: The function should be adaptable to different file descriptors, showcasing the flexibility of linked list usage in managing multiple input sources.

### Methodology:
The project encourages participants to deepen their understanding of file I/O, dynamic memory allocation, and buffer management. The addition of linked list implementation serves as an opportunity to explore the benefits of data structures in managing multiple instances of the get_next_line function.

### Assessment:
Evaluation is based on the accurate and efficient implementation of the get_next_line function, with specific attention to the successful incorporation of linked lists for managing multiple file descriptors. Memory management, edge case handling, and adaptability contribute to the overall assessment.

This version of the "get_next_line" project not only reinforces fundamental skills but also provides an additional layer of complexity by incorporating linked lists, thereby enhancing participants' understanding of data structures and their practical applications in real-world programming scenarios.
