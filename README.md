The "get_next_line" project holds a special place as one of my favorite endeavors. Instead of opting for the common approach of using arrays, I chose to implement it with linked lists. This decision presented its own set of challenges, especially when seeking assistance from fellow cadets who predominantly worked with arrays. Nonetheless, this experience proved invaluable in my learning journey.

This project served as a platform for honing my skills in working with linked lists, understanding the nuances of pointers and pointer manipulation, and mastering the intricacies of memory allocation and deallocation. By tackling the complexities of managing memory efficiently, I not only enhanced my coding proficiency but also gained a deeper insight into the inner workings of memory management in C++.

Furthermore, "get_next_line" became a pivotal exercise for incorporating tools like Valgrind into my development process. Leveraging Valgrind, I was able to meticulously scrutinize memory usage, identify potential leaks, and refine my code for optimal performance. Thus, this project not only contributed to my technical skills but also underscored the importance of thorough memory management and debugging practices in software development.
