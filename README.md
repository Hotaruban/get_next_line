# get_next_line

get_next_line is untill now one of my favorite project.
I used to do it with link list instead of array, most of cadet of my campus used to do it with array, so it was hard to find help.

I used this project to learn how to use the link list, the pointer of pointer and manage allocation and free of memory.

I use also this project to learn how to use valgrind to check the memory free and improve my code.

It took me 18 days to finish it.
